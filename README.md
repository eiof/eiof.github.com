This is my digital portfolio. It's simple, on purpose.

- There's no build phase, no remembering APIs, just HTML
- I am using some formatting tools, but those can be swapped out later
- I chose a utility-css library, [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/), for low-effort design
- It's hosted via Github Pages, and all resources are on CDNs
- I've audited for accessibility using [aXe](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
